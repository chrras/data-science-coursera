# Course Description

In this course you will learn how to program in R and how to use R for effective data analysis. You will learn how to install and configure software necessary for a statistical programming environment, discuss generic programming language concepts as they are implemented in a high-level statistical language. The course covers practical issues in statistical computing which includes programming in R, reading data into R, accessing R packages, writing R functions, debugging, and organizing and commenting R code. Topics in statistical data analysis and optimization will provide working examples.

# Course Content

* Week 1: Overview of R, R data types and objects, reading and writing data
* Week 2: Control structures, functions, scoping rules, dates and times
* Week 3: Loop functions, debugging tools
* Week 4: Simulation, code profiling

# Lecture Materials

Lecture videos will be released weekly and will be available for the week and thereafter. You are welcome to view them at your convenience. Accompanying each video lecture will be a PDF copy of the slides and a link to an HTML5 version of the slides.

## Background lectures

Background lectures about the content of the course with respect to other quantitative courses, course logistics, and the R programming language are provided as reference material. It is not necessary to watch the videos to complete the course, however you may find them useful.

# Assessments

## Quizzes

There will be one quiz every week. The quizzes will all open on the first day of the course but they will be due weekly. So the Week 1 Quiz will be due at the end of the first week and the Week 2 Quiz will be due at the end of the second week, etc.

Please refer to the individual weekly Quiz deadlines to see the exact date and time that each Quiz is due.

## Programming Assignments

There will be three required programming assignments. The first programming assignment is due at the end of the second week. Subsequent programming assignments are due weekly after that.

Programming Assignments 1 and 3 will be graded via unit tests using a submission script that will compare the output of your functions to the correct output. To access Programming Assignments 1 and 3, click the corresponding link in the left navigation bar.

Programming Assignment 2 will be submitted differently and graded via a peer assessment. To access Programming Assignment 2, click the corresponding link in the left navigation bar.

## swirl Programming Assignment (optional)

In this course, you have the option to use the swirl R package to practice some of the concepts we cover in lectures.

Each lesson that you complete in swirl is worth one extra credit point. However, the maximum number of points you may earn for the assignment is capped at 5. While these lessons will give you valuable practice and you are encouraged to complete as many as possible, please note that they are completely optional and you can get full marks in the class without completing them.

You can find the instructions for how to install and use swirl in the Programming Assignments section of the course under Week 1.

# Grading

## Quizzes

You may attempt each quiz up to 3 times. The score of your most successful atempt will count toward your grade.

## Programming Assignments

Programming assignments 1 and 3 will require submissions via a submission script. You may make an unlimited number of submissions for of the programming assignments 1 and 3, and your most successful submission will count toward your grade. The swirl Programming Assignment is completely optional and extra credit.

## Hard deadlines and soft deadlines for Quizzes 1-3 and Programming Assignment 1

The reported due date is the soft deadline for quizzes 1-3 and programming assignment 1. You may turn in quizzes 1-3 and programming assignment 1 up to five days after the soft deadline. The hard deadline is five days after the Quiz is due at 23:30 UTC. If you submit after the due date (but before the hard deadline), your submission score will be penalized by 10% for each day after the due date. If you use a late day, the 10% per day penalty will not be applied for that day.

**Please note: There is no partial credit grace period for Quiz 4 or Programming Assignments 2 and 3. Those deadlines are firm, and work submitted after the hard deadline will not receive credit.**

## Late Days for Quizzes and Programming Assignment 1

You are permitted a total of 5 late days for quizzes and assignments in the course. If you use a late day, your quiz or assignment grade will not be affected if it is submitted late.

## No Late Days for Programming Assignment 2

Peer assessments deadlines have to be synchronous. Therefore, Late Days cannot be applied to Programming Assignment 2. Only one deadline can be set for students to submit and peer-grade each other's work. This is necessary in order to maintain a synchronized peer grading process.

## Points and scoring

There are 100 points available in the course. The breakdown of points is as follows:

* Week 1 Quiz - 20 points
* Week 2 Quiz - 10 points
* Week 3 Quiz - 5 points
* Week 4 Quiz - 10 points
* Programming Assignment 1 (Air Pollution) - 20 points
* Programming Assignment 2 (Lexical Scoping) - 10 points
* Programming Assignment 3 (Hospital Quality) - 25 points
* swirl Programming Assignment - Maximum of 5 extra credit points

You must earn 70 points to pass the course and earn a certificate. Students who earn 90 points and above will receive a certificate with Distinction.
